# Craft_and_Folk_Art_Museum_Mobile_App

This project is being developed to serve as an alterntaive to booking tours with the Craft and Folk Art Museum directly. Eunice Lee, the museum's Public Programs Coordinator, and I worked together to come up with the design of this self-guided tour app. The application will let visitors listen to pre-recorded audio of the exhibitions on each floor of the musuem. The app also lets users know about any upcoming programs, general information regarding the museum and a way to purchase from the museums store. 

As of right now, May 31st 2018. The app can run on both iOS and Android devices (tested on live devices). I need to work on a few other things, mainly testing, caching of images for faster runtime and download speeds. 

I hope to have the app deployed to Google Play Store and the App Store by the Fall of 2018.
